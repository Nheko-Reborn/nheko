The motivation behind the project is to provide a native desktop app for [Matrix] that
feels more like a mainstream chat app ([Riot], Telegram etc) and less like an IRC client.

### Note regarding End-to-End encryption

Currently the implementation is at best a **proof of concept** and it should only be used for
testing purposes.

## Features

Most of the features you would expect from a chat application are missing right now
but we are getting close to a more feature complete client.
Specifically there is support for:
- E2E encryption (text messages only: attachments are currently sent unencrypted).
- User registration.
- Creating, joining & leaving rooms.
- Sending & receiving invites.
- Sending & receiving files and emoji (inline widgets for images, audio and file messages).
- Typing notifications.
- Username auto-completion.
- Message & mention notifications.
- Redacting messages.
- Read receipts.
- Basic communities support.
- Room switcher (ctrl-K).
- Light, Dark & System themes.

## Installation

### Releases

Releases for Linux (AppImage), macOS (disk image) & Windows (x64 installer)
can be found in the [Github releases](https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/releases).

### Repositories

#### Arch Linux
```bash
pacaur -S nheko # nheko-git
```

#### Fedora
```bash
sudo dnf install nheko
```

#### Gentoo Linux
```bash
sudo layman -a matrix
sudo emerge -a nheko
```

#### Alpine Linux (and postmarketOS)

Make sure you have the testing repositories from `edge` enabled. Note that this is not needed on postmarketOS.

```sh
sudo apk add nheko
```

#### Flatpak

```
flatpak install flathub io.github.NhekoReborn.Nheko
```

#### macOS (10.12 and above)

with [macports](https://www.macports.org/) :

```sh
sudo port install nheko
```

### Build Requirements

- Qt5 (5.8 or greater). Qt 5.7 adds support for color font rendering with
  Freetype, which is essential to properly support emoji, 5.8 adds some features
  to make interopability with Qml easier.
- CMake 3.1 or greater.
- [mtxclient](https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/mtxclient)
- [LMDB](https://symas.com/lightning-memory-mapped-database/)
- [cmark](https://github.com/commonmark/cmark)
- Boost 1.66 or greater.
- [libolm](https://git.matrix.org/git/olm)
- [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium)
- [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)
- A compiler that supports C++ 14:
    - Clang 5 (tested on Travis CI)
    - GCC 7 (tested on Travis CI)
    - MSVC 19.13 (tested on AppVeyor)

#### Linux

If you don't want to install any external dependencies, you can generate an AppImage locally using docker.

```bash
make docker-app-image
```

##### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S qt5-base \
    qt5-tools \
    qt5-multimedia \
    qt5-svg \
    cmake \
    gcc \
    fontconfig \
    lmdb \
    cmark \
    boost \
    libsodium
```

##### Gentoo Linux

```bash
sudo emerge -a ">=dev-qt/qtgui-5.7.1" media-libs/fontconfig
```

##### Ubuntu (e.g 14.04)

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:beineri/opt-qt592-trusty
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:george-edison55/cmake-3.x
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r-test
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y g++-7 qt59base qt59svg qt59tools qt59multimedia cmake liblmdb-dev libsodium-dev
```

##### macOS (Xcode 8 or later)

```bash
brew update
brew install qt5 lmdb cmake llvm libsodium spdlog boost cmark
```

##### Windows

1. Install Visual Studio 2017's "Desktop Development" and "Linux Development with C++"
(for the CMake integration) workloads.

2. Download the latest Qt for windows installer and install it somewhere.
Make sure to install the `MSVC 2017 64-bit` toolset for at least Qt 5.9
(lower versions does not support VS2017).

3. Install dependencies with `vcpkg`. You can simply clone it into a subfolder
of the root nheko source directory.

```powershell
git clone http:\\github.com\Microsoft\vcpkg
cd vcpkg
.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
.\vcpkg install --triplet x64-windows \
	boost-asio \
	boost-beast \
	boost-iostreams \
	boost-random \
	boost-signals2 \
	boost-system \
	boost-thread \
	cmark \
	libsodium \
	lmdb \
	openssl \
	zlib
```

4. Install dependencies not managed by vcpkg. (libolm, libmtxclient, libmatrix_structs)

Inside the project root run the following (replacing the path to vcpkg as necessary).

```bash
cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -Hdeps -B.deps
        -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/Users/<your-path>/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
        -DUSE_BUNDLED_BOOST=OFF
cmake --build .deps --config Release
cmake --build .deps --config Debug
```

### Building

First we need to install the rest of the dependencies that are not available in our system

```bash
cmake -Hdeps -B.deps \
    -DUSE_BUNDLED_BOOST=OFF # if we already have boost & spdlog installed.
    -DUSE_BUNDLED_SPDLOG=OFF
cmake --build .deps
```

We can now build nheko by pointing it to the path that we installed the dependencies.

```bash
cmake -H. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=.deps/usr
cmake --build build
```

If the build fails with the following error
```
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Qt5Widgets" with
any of the following names:

Qt5WidgetsConfig.cmake
qt5widgets-config.cmake
```
You might need to pass `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to cmake to point it at your qt5 install.

e.g on macOS

```
cmake -H. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$(brew --prefix qt5)
cmake --build build
```

The `nheko` binary will be located in the `build` directory.

#### Windows

After installing all dependencies, you need to edit the `CMakeSettings.json` to
be able to load and compile nheko within Visual Studio.

You need to fill out the paths for the `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` and the `Qt5_DIR`.
The toolchain file should point to the `vcpkg.cmake` and the Qt5 dir to the `lib\cmake\Qt5` dir.

Examples for the paths are:
 - `C:\\vcpkg\\scripts\\buildsystems\\vcpkg.cmake`
 - `C:\\Qt\\5.10.1\\msvc2017_64\\lib\\cmake\\Qt5`

Now right click into the root nheko source directory and choose `Open in Visual Studio`.
You can choose the build type Release and Debug in the top toolbar. 
After a successful CMake generation you can select the `nheko.exe` as the run target.
Now choose `Build all` in the CMake menu or press `F7` to compile the executable.

To be able to run the application the last step is to install the needed Qt dependencies next to the
nheko binary.

Start the "Qt x.xx.x 64-bit for Desktop (MSVC 2017)" command promt and run `windeployqt`.
```cmd
cd <path-to-nheko>\build-vc\Release\Release
windeployqt nheko.exe
```

The final binary will be located inside `build-vc\Release\Release` for the Release build
and `build-vc\Debug\Debug` for the Debug build.
