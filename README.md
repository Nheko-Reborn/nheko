The motivation behind the project is to provide a native desktop app for [Matrix] that
feels more like a mainstream chat app ([Element], Telegram etc) and less like an IRC client.

Help us with translations so as many people as possible will be able to use nheko!

### Note regarding End-to-End encryption

The current implementation is mostly stable, but it was never audited. If you
rely on it for security, we can't make any guarantees.

## Features

Most of the features you would expect from a chat application are missing right now
but we are getting close to a more feature complete client.
Specifically there is support for:
- E2E encryption.
- VoIP calls (voice & video).
- User registration.
- Creating, joining & leaving rooms.
- Sending & receiving invites.
- Sending & receiving files and emoji (inline widgets for images, audio and file messages).
- Replies with text, images and other media (and actually render them as inline widgets).
- Typing notifications.
- Username auto-completion.
- Message & mention notifications.
- Redacting messages.
- Read receipts.
- Basic communities support.
- Room switcher (ctrl-K).
- Light, Dark & System themes.
- Creating separate profiles (command line only, use `-p name`).

## Installation

### Releases

Releases for Linux (AppImage), macOS (disk image) & Windows (x64 installer)
can be found in the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/releases).

### Repositories

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/tiny-repos/nheko.svg)](https://repology.org/project/nheko/versions)

#### Arch Linux

```bash
pacaur -S nheko # nheko-git
```

Nheko requires a secret server to run, so you'll need to install and configure a service such as [KDE Wallet](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/KDE_Wallet) or [GNOME Keyring](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GNOME/Keyring) if not provided by your desktop environment.

Binary releases of the stable builds are available (using [Open Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/)). To add this [unofficial repository](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unofficial_user_repositories), execute the following block after reviewing the [PKGBUILD and service files](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:digital_mystik:AUR/nheko):

```
curl -s 'https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/digital_mystik:/AUR/Arch/x86_64/home_digital_mystik_AUR_Arch.key' | sudo pacman-key -a - && sudo pacman-key --lsign-key 4D41B287F3ABC4B8
echo '
[home_digital_mystik_AUR_Arch]
Server = https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/digital_mystik:/AUR/Arch/x86_64/' | sudo tee --append /etc/pacman.conf
sudo pacman -Syu nheko
```

This imports the repository's public PGP key and locally signs it, adds the pertinent entry to `/etc/pacman.conf`, and installs nheko after updating the databases/system; one can now treat nheko as a typical package. 

To undo these changes, delete the repository entry from `/etc/pacman.conf`, and remove the public signing key with `sudo pacman-key -d 4D41B287F3ABC4B8`.

#### Debian (10 and above) / Ubuntu (18.04 and above)

```bash
sudo apt install nheko
```

### FAQ

---

**Q:** Why don't videos run for me on Windows?

**A:** You're probably missing the required video codecs, download [K-Lite Codec Pack](https://codecguide.com/download_kl.htm).

---

**Q:** What commands are supported by nheko?

**A:** See <https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/wiki/Commands>

---

**Q:** Does nheko support end-to-end encryption (EE2E)?

**A:** Yes, see [feature list](#features)

---

**Q:** Can I test a bleeding edge development version?

**A:** Checkout nightly builds <https://matrix-static.neko.dev/room/!TshDrgpBNBDmfDeEGN:neko.dev/>

---

**Q:** How do I add stickers and custom emojis?

**A:** Stickers and custom emojis are organized in image packs. There is one
user image pack that only your account has access to and there are room image
packs that are accessible by everyone in the room they are defined in. You can
activate a room image pack globally to use it in any room.

To manage image packs in nheko, go to the room settings and enter the Sticker &
Emote Settings. You will see the Private pack (your user image pack) and can
edit it there. The Shortcode is a unique identifier you use to select the image
with and the Body is the alternate text that is displayed on clients that don't
support images (like the alt tag in HTML images).

If you have the necessary permissions you can create new room packs with the
button at the bottom of the image pack list. They are the same as the user pack
but you can create as many as you want and everyone in the room can use them. It
might be a good idea to create an extra room just for your image packs to make
sharing easier.

### Build Requirements

- Qt5 (5.15 or greater). Required for overlapping hover handlers in Qml.
- CMake 3.15 or greater. (Lower version may work, but may break boost linking)
- [mtxclient](https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/mtxclient)
- [coeurl](https://nheko.im/nheko-reborn/coeurl)
- [LMDB](https://symas.com/lightning-memory-mapped-database/)
- [lmdb++](https://github.com/hoytech/lmdbxx)
- [cmark](https://github.com/commonmark/cmark) 0.29 or greater.
- [libolm](https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm)
- [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)
- [GStreamer](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer) 1.18.0 or greater (optional, needed for VoIP support. Pass `-DVOIP=OFF` to disable.).
    - Installing the gstreamer core library plus gst-plugins-base, gst-plugins-good & gst-plugins-bad
      is often sufficient. The qmlgl plugin though is often packaged separately. The actual plugin requirements
      are as follows:
    - Voice call support: dtls, opus, rtpmanager, srtp, webrtc
    - Video call support (optional): compositor, opengl, qmlgl, rtp, vpx
    - [libnice](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libnice/libnice)
- XCB, XCB-EWMH: For screensharing support on X11. VOIP needs to be enabled. Can be disabled with `-DSCREENSHARE_X11=OFF`.
- [qtkeychain](https://github.com/frankosterfeld/qtkeychain) (You need at least version 0.12 for proper Gnome Keychain support. The bundled version requires libsecret, unless you pass `-DLIBSECRET_SUPPORT=OFF`.)
- A compiler that supports C++ 17:
    - Clang 6 (tested on Travis CI)
    - GCC 7 (tested on Travis CI)
    - MSVC 19.13 (tested on AppVeyor)

Nheko can use bundled version for most of those libraries automatically, if the versions in your distro are too old.
To use them, you can enable the hunter integration by passing `-DHUNTER_ENABLED=ON`.
It is probably wise to link those dependencies statically by passing `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF`
You can select which bundled dependencies you want to use by passing various `-DUSE_BUNDLED_*` flags. By default all dependencies are bundled *if* you enable hunter. (The exception to that is OpenSSL, which is always disabled by default.)
If you experience build issues and you are trying to link `mtxclient` library without hunter, make sure the library version(commit) as mentioned in the `CMakeList.txt` is used. Sometimes we have to make breaking changes in `mtxclient` and for that period the master branch of both repos may not be compatible.

The bundle flags are currently:

- USE_BUNDLED_SPDLOG
- USE_BUNDLED_OLM
- USE_BUNDLED_GTEST
- USE_BUNDLED_CMARK
- USE_BUNDLED_JSON
- USE_BUNDLED_OPENSSL
- USE_BUNDLED_MTXCLIENT
- USE_BUNDLED_LMDB
- USE_BUNDLED_LMDBXX
- USE_BUNDLED_COEURL
- USE_BUNDLED_LIBCURL
- USE_BUNDLED_LIBEVENT

A note on bundled OpenSSL: You need to explicitly enable it and it will not be using your system certificate directory by default, if you enable it. You need to override that at runtime with the SSL_CERT_FILE variable. On Windows it will still be using your system certificates though, since it loads them from the system store instead of the OpenSSL directory.

#### Linux

If you don't want to install any external dependencies, you can generate an AppImage locally using docker. It is not that well maintained though...

```bash
make docker-app-image
```

##### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S qt5-base \
    qt5-tools \
    qt5-multimedia \
    qt5-svg \
    cmake \
    gcc \
    fontconfig \
    lmdb \
    cmark \
    boost \
    qtkeychain-qt5
```

##### Gentoo Linux

```bash
sudo emerge -a ">=dev-qt/qtgui-5.10.0" media-libs/fontconfig dev-libs/qtkeychain
```

##### Ubuntu 20.04

```bash
# Build requirements + qml modules needed at runtime (you may not need all of them, but the following seem to work according to reports):
sudo apt install g++ cmake zlib1g-dev libssl-dev qt{base,declarative,tools,multimedia,quickcontrols2-}5-dev libqt5svg5-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-thread-dev libboost-iostreams-dev libolm-dev liblmdb++-dev libcmark-dev nlohmann-json3-dev libspdlog-dev libgtest-dev qml-module-qt{gstreamer,multimedia,quick-extras,-labs-settings,-labs-platform,graphicaleffects,quick-controls2} qt5keychain-dev libevent-dev libcurl-dev
```
This will install all dependencies, except for tweeny (use bundled tweeny)
and mtxclient (needs to be build separately).

##### Debian Buster (or higher probably)

(User report, not sure if all of those are needed)

```bash
sudo apt install cmake gcc make automake liblmdb-dev \
    qt5-default libssl-dev libqt5multimedia5-plugins libqt5multimediagsttools5 libqt5multimediaquick5 libqt5svg5-dev \
    qml-module-qtgstreamer qtmultimedia5-dev qtquickcontrols2-5-dev qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools qtdeclarative5-dev \
    qml-module-qtgraphicaleffects qml-module-qtmultimedia qml-module-qtquick-controls2 qml-module-qtquick-layouts  qml-module-qt-labs-platform\
    qt5keychain-dev
```

##### Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install qt5-qtbase-devel qt5-linguist qt5-qtsvg-devel qt5-qtmultimedia-devel \
    qt5-qtquickcontrols2-devel qtkeychain-qt5-devel spdlog-devel openssl-devel \
    libolm-devel cmark-devel lmdb-devel lmdbxx-devel tweeny-devel 
```

##### Guix

```bash
guix environment nheko
```

##### macOS (Xcode 10.2 or later)


```bash
brew update
brew install qt5 lmdb cmake llvm spdlog boost cmark libolm qtkeychain
```

##### Windows

1. Install Visual Studio 2017's "Desktop Development" and "Linux Development with C++"
(for the CMake integration) workloads.

2. Download the latest Qt for windows installer and install it somewhere.
Make sure to install the `MSVC 2017 64-bit` toolset for at least Qt 5.10
(lower versions does not support VS2017).

3. If you don't have openssl installed, you will need to install perl to build it (i.e. Strawberry Perl).

### Building

We can now build nheko:

```bash
cmake -S. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

To use bundled dependencies you can use hunter, i.e.:

```bash
cmake -S. -Bbuild -DHUNTER_ENABLED=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DUSE_BUNDLED_OPENSSL=OFF
cmake --build build --config Release
```

Adapt the USE_BUNDLED_* as needed.

If the build fails with the following error
```
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Qt5Widgets" with
any of the following names:

Qt5WidgetsConfig.cmake
qt5widgets-config.cmake
```
You might need to pass `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to cmake to point it at your qt5 install.

e.g on macOS

```
cmake -S. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$(brew --prefix qt5)
cmake --build build
```

The `nheko` binary will be located in the `build` directory.

#### Windows

After installing all dependencies, you need to edit the `CMakeSettings.json` to
be able to load and compile nheko within Visual Studio.

You need to fill out the paths for the `Qt5_DIR`.
The Qt5 dir should point to the `lib\cmake\Qt5` dir.

Examples for the paths are:
 - `C:\\Qt\\5.10.1\\msvc2017_64\\lib\\cmake\\Qt5`

You should also enable hunter by setting `HUNTER_ENABLED` to `ON` and `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` to `OFF`.

Now right click into the root nheko source directory and choose `Open in Visual Studio`.
You can choose the build type Release and Debug in the top toolbar.
After a successful CMake generation you can select the `nheko.exe` as the run target.
Now choose `Build all` in the CMake menu or press `F7` to compile the executable.

To be able to run the application the last step is to install the needed Qt dependencies next to the
nheko binary.

Start the "Qt x.xx.x 64-bit for Desktop (MSVC 2017)" command promt and run `windeployqt`.
```cmd
cd <path-to-nheko>\build-vc\Release\Release
windeployqt nheko.exe
```

The final binary will be located inside `build-vc\Release\Release` for the Release build
and `build-vc\Debug\Debug` for the Debug build.

Also copy the respective cmark.dll to the binary dir from `build/cmark-build/src/Release` (or Debug).
