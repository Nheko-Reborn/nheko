== NAME

nheko - Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17

== SYNOPSIS

*nheko* [_OPTIONS_]

== DESCRIPTION

The motivation behind the project is to provide a native desktop app for Matrix
that feels more like a mainstream chat app (Element, Telegram etc) and less like
an IRC client.

== OPTIONS

*-h*, *--help*::
Displays help on commandline options.

*--help-all*::
Displays help including Qt specific options.

*-v*, *--version*::
Displays version information.

*--debug*::
Alias for _--log-level trace_.

*-l*, *--log-level* _<level>_::
Set the global log level, or a comma-separated list of _<component>=<level>_
pairs, or both. For example, to set the default log level to _warn_ but
disable logging for the _ui_ component, pass _warn,ui=off_.
+
levels: _trace_ _debug_ _info_ _warning_ _error_ _critical_ _off_
+
components: _crypto_ _db_ _mtx_ _net_ _qml_ _ui_
+
Log levels can also be set in the NHEKO_LOG_LEVEL environment variable, using
the same syntax. It will be overridden by this command line option.

*-L*, *--log-type* _<type>_::
Set the log output type. A comma-separated list is allowed. The default is _file,stderr_.
+
types: _file_ _stderr_ _none_
+
The log type can also be set in the NHEKO_LOG_TYPE environment variable,
which will be overridden by this command line option.

*-p* _<profile>_, *--profile* _<profile>_::
Creates a unique profile, which allows you to log into several accounts at the
same time and start multiple instances of nheko. Use _default_ to start with the
default profile.

== FAQ

=== How do I add stickers and custom emojis?

Stickers and custom emojis are organized in image packs. There is one user image
pack that only your account has access to and there are room image packs that
are accessible by everyone in the room they are defined in. You can activate a
room image pack globally to use it in any room.

To manage image packs in nheko, go to the room settings and enter the Sticker &
Emote Settings. You will see the Private pack (your user image pack) and can
edit it there. The Shortcode is a unique identifier you use to select the image
with and the Body is the alternate text that is displayed on clients that don't
support images (like the alt tag in HTML images).

If you have the necessary permissions you can create new room packs with the
button at the bottom of the image pack list. They are the same as the user pack
but you can create as many as you want and everyone in the room can use them. It
might be a good idea to create an extra room just for your image packs to make
sharing easier.

== COMPLETERS

Completers spawn a popup with completion candidates when you type them in
the input line.

*@*::
Open username completer.

*#*::

*~*::
